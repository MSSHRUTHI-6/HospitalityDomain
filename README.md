# HospitalityDomain
Developed a Power BI project in the hospitality domain using Excel as the data source. Identified issues in the Bangalore region, revealing key operational inefficiencies. Focused on metrics like occupancy rate, ADR, RevPAR, guest satisfaction, and booking trends, enabling data-driven insights and actionable strategies for improvement.
Objective:
To analyze the operational and performance metrics of hotels in the hospitality sector, focusing on Pareto analysis to identify inefficiencies, particularly in the Bangalore region.
The project uses Excel as the data source and visualizes insights through Power BI with donut and bar charts.

Occupancy Rate:

Percentage of available rooms occupied.
Indicates demand and operational efficiency.
Average Daily Rate (ADR):

Revenue generated per occupied room.
Highlights pricing strategies.
Revenue Per Available Room (RevPAR):

Combines occupancy and ADR to assess performance.
Useful for trend analysis.
Guest Satisfaction Score:

Derived from surveys or reviews.
Key to understanding guest experiences.
Booking Trends:

Patterns in booking times, durations, and sources.
Helps in demand forecasting.
Cancellations and No-shows:

Rates and reasons for dropped bookings.
Impacts revenue and occupancy planning.
Regional Performance:

Focus on Bangalore region to identify specific challenges.
Cross-compare with other regions.
Visualizations:
Donut Chart:

Used to visualize proportional data such as revenue share, occupancy distribution, or guest demographics.
Example: Compare Bangalore region revenue against other regions.
Bar Chart:

Used for trend analysis, such as monthly occupancy rates or ADR over time.
Example: Display seasonality trends or Pareto analysis to identify the most impactful issues.
Insights:
Pareto Analysis:

Identified that 80% of issues arise from 20% of problem areas, with Bangalore being a significant contributor.
Issues include lower ADR and guest satisfaction.
Trend Analysis:

Monthly trends revealed a drop in occupancy during off-seasons, emphasizing the need for promotions.
Booking rates spiked during festivals but showed cancellations due to pricing.
Actionable Insights:
